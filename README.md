# Cybersecurity Professional
Hey thereâ€”Iâ€™m a cybersecurity nut with 3+ years in SOC and controls, based in Region 3 (near Philly). Security+ certified, MS in SCADA Cybersecurityâ€”Iâ€™ve been digging into SIEM, taming vulns, and geeking out over NIST. Passionate about CISAâ€™s infra mission, Iâ€™m cooking up scripts to share.

## Coming Soon
- **Scripts**: Splunk parsers, Nessus automation (Python/PowerShell).
- **Goal**: Lock down Region 3 infrastructure with NIST/RMF flair.
